# DNN APU

This is a APU (Algorithm Processing Unit) sample that deployed a deep neural network. The deep neural network is 
generated by hls4ml tutorial_1. 

The DNN_APU.sv is the top level module for the APU. The folder DNN_MODEL contains the deep neural network model, 
which is a submodule of the APU.
