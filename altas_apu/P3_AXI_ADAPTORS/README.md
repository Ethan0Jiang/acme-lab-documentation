# AXI adaptors

This project contains two APU adaptors, a read port adaptor and a write port adaptor, and a APU wrapper.

The read port adaptor can convert the origin signal of GEP to follow the AXI protocol.

The write port adaptor can convert the AXI protocal signal back to the orginal GEP signals. 

Two adaptor need to be connected with the AXI APU to function properly. The AXI APU is in P4 or P5.
