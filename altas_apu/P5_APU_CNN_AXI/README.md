# APU SAMPLE follows AXI protocol depolyed CNN algo 

This is a APU (Algorithm Processing Unit) sample, which follows the AXI protocol. This is a upgraded version of the privous APU sample, with depolyment of conv2d algorithm.    

In order to connected to the current GEP, the AXI APU needs to be connected to the 
[APU adaptors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sbIqujR-CAVMUYwRBwtQhkEeYgicR_teQE0yRj4MxGk/edit?usp=sharing).
