# APU testing

This folder contains two APU testing projects. 

One is a sandBox for simulation testing located at `\gep-fw\Projects\app\GepAlgToy_x`

The other one is a testVehicle for on-board testing located at `\gep-fw\Projects\tv\GepFrameworkTestVehicle2022a`

Two projects need to be open with vivado 2020.2

After opening the project, user can try to test different APUs by replacing the existing APU with their own APU.
